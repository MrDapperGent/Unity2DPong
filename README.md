2DPong
======

Unity 2D Pong, with physics!

Made entirely out of Unity's new 2D system and with physics in mind. Very minimal project with very well structured code and logic. Easy to understand and here for people to learn from.

Controls are W and S for Player 1 and Up Arrow and Down Arrow for Player 2.
